Pure Python script for Sorting and Arranging Files in a Directory

This Python program is designed to sort and arrange files in a directory based on their file extension. The program loops through each file in the directory, checks its file extension, and moves it to the corresponding directory based on a pre-defined dictionary that maps file extensions to their corresponding directories.

## Getting Started
To use this program, you will need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Once you have Python installed, download the sort_files.py file from this repository and save it in the directory where you want to sort and arrange your files.

## Usage
To use the program, open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the sort_files.py file is located. Then, run the following command:

Copy code
```python
python sort_files.py
```
The program will then loop through each file in the directory, check its file extension, and move it to the corresponding directory based on the pre-defined dictionary. The program will print a message to confirm that the files have been sorted and arranged successfully.

**Note** : You can modify the file_extensions dictionary in the program to add or remove file extensions and corresponding directories as needed.
